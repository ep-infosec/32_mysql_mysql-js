/**********************
  This Converter can read and write binary columns using MySQL's 
  wl#8132 "Binary JSON" encoding -- including JSON columns,
  introduced in MySQL 5.7, which natively use this format.

  It functions as a drop-in replacement for the Jones JSONConverter.

  Reading from DB to JavaScript, this converter takes a node Buffer, 
  attempts to parse it, and, if succesful, returns the deserialized 
  JavaScript value.
