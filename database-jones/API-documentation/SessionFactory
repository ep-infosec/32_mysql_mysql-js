/** openSession() : open a database session object
 * ASYNC
 *
 * Session provides a context for database transactions and operations.
 * Each independent user should have its own Session.
 *
 * The resources required for sessions are allocated in advance. 
 * It may return an error in the callback indicating that those resources are 
 * not available.
 *
 * This function returns a promise.  On success, the promise will be fulfilled 
 * with a Session.  The optional callback receives an error value and a 
 * Session.  Any extra arguments passed after the callback function will
 * be returned to the callback verbatim.
 * 
 * The "mappings" parameter can be used to preload metadata for application 
 * tables and to validate the defind mappings between stored data and 
 * JavaScript objects.  If mappings contains a string table name, a Domain 
 * Object Constructor function, or an array of these, then metadata is loaded 
 * from the database and validated against the requirements of the mapping.
 * If mappings is undefined, null, or an empty array, no mappings will be 
 * loaded or validated; this means validation is deferred until tables are 
 * used in application code.
 *  
 * @param mappings    mappings to validate when connection is made
 * @param callback    the function to call when the session is ready for use
 * @param additional  parameters will be returned in the callback
 * @return promise
 * @async
